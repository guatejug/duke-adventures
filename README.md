#The Duke's Adventures

For GuateJUG volunteers the tour has been an opportunity to rediscover the country, while speaking of Java, IT and life as a IT professional, one life opportunity that has reached our reach thanks to Java.

To name a few one of our speakers (VÃ­ctor Orozco) was recently elected to be a faculty member in order to increase IT literacy in our country by taking university knowledge outside the classrooms, we also started a JDuchess chapter led by (Mercedes Wyss) since we noted that woman need a boost in STEM degrees and opportunities.
